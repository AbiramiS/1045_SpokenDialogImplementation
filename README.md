7.About (Short Description / Summary):Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) are speech based interfaces for Human Computer Interaction (HCI). User Interfaces (UI) such as electro-mechanical keyboards, mouse enabled graphical interaction has evolved ever since the first computers were made. This very evolution has changed the way we use computers to perform our day-to-day tasks. More recently touch  interfaces and speech interfaces have become mainstream owing to the wide acceptance of hand-held mobile devices (such as smart phones, tablets). Speech interfaces are programmable and thus can be adapted towards its intended users. This project deals with optimization of speech interfaces also known as SDS. Any effort to find an optimized SDS should focus on two things (i) adapting the interfaces to its potential users and (ii) accomplishing the dialogue task (such as ticket booking, restaurant selection etc). It is envisioned to cast the dialog management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dialog optimization.

8.Install (Installation procedure): Step by step procedure to install software.
